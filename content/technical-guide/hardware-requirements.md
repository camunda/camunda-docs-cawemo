{{< note title="Heads Up!" class="warning" >}}
Exact hardware requirements highly depend on a number of factors such as: the browser used, number of BPMN workflows, comments etc, network speed, concurrently logged-in users. Therefore we cannot guarantee that following requirements will exactly match every case.
{{< /note >}}

We recommend the following minimum hardware requirements:

- Small size installation (<= 10 concurrently logged-in users)

  - 2 CPU cores
  - 2048 MiB RAM

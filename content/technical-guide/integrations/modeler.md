---

This plugin offers a link between the Camunda Modeler and a Cawemo instance. It syncs all BPMN files that were once exported from Cawemo back into a special project for the configured Cawemo user. This way, a copy of these files is stored in Cawemo whenever they are saved in the Modeler.

# Installation

# Configuration

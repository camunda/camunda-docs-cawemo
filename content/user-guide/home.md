This view is the first view that users see when they log into Cawemo. It shows the list of [projects](../projects) that a user has access to.

## Navigation

In the top of the window, the user can see a breadcrumb navigation. It always shows the 'home' entry which leads back to this view. Any other view that the user navigates to will be represented as a new breadcrumb, showing the hierarchy of entities.

The last breadcrumb might have a drop down menu that can be used to do various actions with the currently opened entity.

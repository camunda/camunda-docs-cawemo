This view shows the content of a catalog.

## Collaboration / Access Rights

Other than [projects](../projects), catalogs do not allow you to manage access rights. All [members of your organization](../settings#managing-members-admin-only) automatically have _read-only_ access to your catalog, meaning that they can see your templates, but not edit them. 

As the creator and owner of a catalog, only you have the right to create, edit, and delete templates.

## Import

Templates can be imported by dragging and dropping a JSON file from your local file system onto the catalog's list of templates. Alternatively, you can select one or more templates by clicking on the blue action button on the upper right corner and select "Import JSON file".

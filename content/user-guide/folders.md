This view shows the content of a folder.

## Collaboration / Access Rights

Other than [projects](../projects), folders do not allow you to directly manage access rights.
Instead, they inherit the access right configuration from the project they are located in.

## Import

Diagrams can be added to a folder by dragging and dropping a BPMN or DMN XML file from the local file system onto the list of diagrams in the folder.

Catalog projects and templates require a valid Enterprise license.

This view shows the content of a catalog project.

## Collaboration / Access Rights

Other than [projects](../projects), catalog projects do not allow you to manage access rights. All [members of your organization](../settings#managing-members-admin-only) automatically have _read-only_ access to your catalog project, meaning that they can see your templates, but not edit them.

As the creator and owner of a catalog project, only you have the right to create, edit, and delete templates.

## Import

Templates can be imported by dragging and dropping a JSON file from your local file system onto the catalog project's list of templates. Alternatively, you can select one or more templates by clicking on the blue action button on the upper right corner and select "Import JSON file".

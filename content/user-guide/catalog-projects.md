This view shows the content of a catalog project.

## Collaboration / Access Rights

Catalog projects are [projects used by integrations](../projects/#projects-used-by-integrations) and do not allow you to manage access rights like [projects created from Cawemo](../projects/#projects-created-from-cawemo) do.

Everyone can create catalog projects but only the owner of a catalog project has the right to create, edit, and delete templates.

## Import

Templates can be imported by dragging and dropping a JSON file from your local file system onto the catalog project's list of templates. Alternatively, you can select one or more templates by clicking on the blue action button on the upper right corner and selecting "Upload files".

This view shows the content of a project and the list of collaborators.

## Collaboration / Access Rights

After creating a project, further Cawemo users can be invited to collaborate. There are three levels of access rights available that can be assigned to each user:

- **Edit:** the user can edit all diagrams within the project and invite further users.
- **Comment:** the user cannot edit diagrams or invite users, but can leave [comments](../diagrams#comments) on each diagram.
- **View:** the user cannot edit diagrams nor leave comments, but view the diagram.

## Import

Diagrams can be added to a project by dragging a BPMN XML file from the local file system.

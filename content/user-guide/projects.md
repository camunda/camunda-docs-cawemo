This view shows the content of a project and the list of collaborators.

## Collaboration / Access Rights

After creating a project, further Cawemo users can be invited to collaborate. There are four roles with different levels of access rights that can be assigned to each user:

- **Project Admin:** the user can edit the project itself, all diagrams within the project and invite further users.
- **Editor:** the user can edit all diagrams within the project and invite further users.
- **Commenter:** the user cannot edit diagrams nor invite users, but can leave [comments](../diagrams#comments) on each diagram.
- **Viewer:** the user cannot edit diagrams nor leave comments, but only view diagrams.

## Import

Diagrams can be added to a project by dragging and dropping a BPMN XML file from the local file system onto the list of diagrams in the project.
